# Employee Permissions Management System

This project is a web-based Employee Permissions Management System that consists of two main modules: Administrator and Employee. The system allows administrators to manage employee information, authorization types, and authorization requests, while employees can submit permission requests and view their request history.

## Features

- **Authorization Type Management:** Add new authorization types (e.g., 1 hour, 2 hours, half-day), enable or disable existing types.
- **Authorization Request Management:** Approve or reject authorization requests submitted by employees.
- **Notification:** Receive notifications for new authorization requests.
- **Profile Management:** Change administrator's own password.
- **Dashboard:** Access the administrator's dashboard with relevant statistics.

### Employee Module

- **Authentication:** Log in using a valid email address and password.
- **Permission Requests:** Submit requests for permission with specified duration and reason.
- **Permission Request History:** View history of previous permission requests along with their status.
